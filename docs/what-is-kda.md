A message regarding exchange listing from Kadena CEO, Will Martino:

> Listing on a premier exchange is a months-long process and it is not something that we have full control over. Moreover, the process is very sensitive and thus we’re unable to share updates and statuses with the transparency we’d prefer. When we reach an agreement and after a contract gets signed, it can take 4-6 weeks for integration.”
