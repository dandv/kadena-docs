We will be providing more support for this user flow in the future. For now, once you have gone to the wallet section of Chainweaver and created an account, you can hit \u201dReceive\u201d at the right side of the screen to bring up the Receive screen and choose \u201cOption 2: Transfer from non-Chainweaver Account.\u201d Then, input details of your non-Chainweaver account and receive the money from that account into the Chainweaver account. Please note that this transaction will charge a small amount of gas. What is the difference between an anonymous vs. vanity account? When you create an anonymous account, it creates an account locally that has the same name as the Public Key. At this point, the account is not yet created on the blockchain. The account will be created on the blockchain once you use it to mine or coins are transferred from another account using transfer-create. To ensure that you have control of your account, the workflow of creating a vanity account sends a transaction to the blockchain to create the account. All transactions cost gas, so you need to pay gas for the transaction. In order to create a vanity account, you need an account on the blockchain that has coins so that you can use it to pay for gas for the vanity account creation. We are planning to make further improvements to explain this difference and also make it clear which accounts are and are not yet on the blockchain. If I create an account in Chainweaver, can I then use it for mining? Yes, once you create an account in Chainweaver, you can copy the public key by clicking the ellipses on the right side of the account row in the Wallet screen and use it to mine. However, mining (as you win blocks) will create your account on all chains. Chainweaver currently will not allow you to create the same account on multiple chains. With this user flow, you could have coins on all chains but would not be able to see them in Chainweaver. We are working on improvements so that you will be able to create the same account on all chains. Will there be a way to consolidate funds on different chains? For now, we are focused on creating the core building blocks of single-chain and cross-chain transfers. We expect tools that care of these things for you to evolve over time. What is a Kadena address? Kadena address is a concatenation of the account name, chain id, possibly the public key if the account name is different, and a checksum (in order to protect against loss of funds from typos). Nodes \u00b6 What are the bootstrap nodes? Here are the Mainnet bootstrap nodes: us-e1.chainweb.com us-e2.chainweb.com us-e3.chainweb.com us-w1.chainweb.com us-w2.chainweb.com us-w3.chainweb.com jp1.chainweb.com jp2.chainweb.com jp3.chainweb.com fr1.chainweb.com fr2.chainweb.com fr3.chainweb.com Here are the Testnet bootstrap nodes: us1.testnet.chainweb.com us2.testnet.chainweb.com eu1.testnet.chainweb.com eu2.testnet.chainweb.com ap1.testnet.chainweb.com ap2.testnet.chainweb.com All bootstrap nodes are running on port 443. Is my node caught up? Compare your node\u2019s cut or block height with one in the network. To get a node\u2019s cut height, run the following command: curl -s https://us-e1.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/cut replacing \u201cus-e1.chainweb.com\u201d with the address of whatever node you want to check. You can also go to the block explorer and see the current block height there. Also, the third-party Kadena Peers page provides an easy way to see the recent block height for many of the nodes in the network. What is cut height? Cut height is the sum of the most recent block height across all chains. Do I need a cert for better reward / node stability? No, chainweb-node produces its own self-signed certificate if not given one. Many nodes run this way without issue. History: This rumour arose in the opening days of the network, when a bug still existed in the P2P logic. Having a pre-made cert improved node health then, but this is no longer an issue. How often should I restart my node? Never. If you're having resource issues, check the other questions here. History: Misconfigured nodes often have performance problems, which temporarily disappear after restarting. Platforms / Operating Systems \u00b6 What operating systems does Chainweaver support? Currently, Chainweaver is only available for Mac. We are also working on a Linux application as a very high priority. As we develop our roadmap, we will be looking at iOS and Android apps as well. Does Chainweaver support a hardware wallet? Hardware wallet support is on our roadmap, further down the line. Smart Contracts \u00b6 Is the Smart Contracts screen the same as pact.kadena.io? Yes, the contracts screen has the same functionality as pact.kadena.io, with some minor changes for the Mac application. Security & Access \u00b6 Where are my private keys stored for Chainweaver accounts? The private keys are stored in encrypted form in ~/Library/Application Support/io.kadena.chainweaver. The password is what decrypts the encrypted file on your disk. How does Recovery work in Chaiweaver? The 12-word recovery phrase is the only thing required to recover all your keys since the phrase is a deterministic generation of keys. Currently, there is no way to recover the vanity accounts or \u201cNotes\u201d; this is something that we are working on. We believe that recovery is a break-glass and often painful process. Still,we are working to improve this. Transactions \u00b6 How do I check my balance? Go to balance checker and enter your account name. When I try to transfer coins to another account it says \"you don\u2019t have enough gas\". What am I doing wrong? You probably don\u2019t have enough coins on the chain you are trying to send from. Coin transfers can only come from one chain at a time. This is possible if you increased the gas price from the default price, or you have a REALLY small balance. Use the balance checker to check your balance on all chains The other possibility for this validation failure is that you didn't sign the transaction appropriately (i.e. the account specified in the \"sender\" field does not correspond with the account that signed the transaction and is being charged for gas). What does the \u201cReceive\u201d button do in Chaiweaver? The \u201cReceive\u201d button at the right side of the screen in main accounts section of the wallet screen shows you a Kadena address that you can then copy and send to the sender. The sender can then use it to send coins to your account. Currently, the button also allows you to receive money into a Chainweaver account from a non-Chainweaver account.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"FAQs/#accounts-keys-and-addresses","text":"Can I import and see the balance of an non-Chainweaver account that I may have created through mining?

Pact allows you to construct coin transfers in a way that guarantees that someone is in possession of the correct private key and it will work to access the coins. This transaction does this by doing two transfers in a single transaction, one from alice to bob for the desired amount plus a small amount extra coins for a test transfer, and one from bob to alice transferring back the extra amount. This is most important when you are doing transfer-create because that is when you are defining the new account's keyset. Signing \u00b6 This transaction must be signed by both the alice and bob accounts and each signature must have the appropriate coin.TRANSFER capability. In this example, the public key for the account alice is 6be2f485a7af75fedb4b7f153a903f7e6000ca4aa501179c91a2450b777bd2a7 and the public key for bob is 368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca .

Pact allows you to construct coin transfers in a way that guarantees that someone is in possession of the correct private key and it will work to access the coins. This transaction does this by doing two transfers in a single transaction, one from alice to bob for the desired amount plus a small amount extra coins for a test transfer, and one from bob to alice transferring back the extra amount. This is most important when you are doing transfer-create because that is when you are defining the new account's keyset.","title":"Safe Transfer"},{"location":"cookbook/safe-transfer/#signing","text":"This transaction must be signed by both the alice and bob accounts and each signature must have the appropriate coin.TRANSFER capability.
